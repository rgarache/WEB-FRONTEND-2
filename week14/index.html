            <p>The type of page I decided to make is a food menu app. It is something simple, capable in the eyes of many, but for me it represents a great challenge.
I consider myself more efficient in applying my curiosity since for something simple I have learned many things that I did not really expect to learn, I am more skilled at seeing everything that I have around me and how I can apply it to my career. Working in a group is not my strong point and I have not considered myself as good at learning from others, I prefer to learn by myself.
I have had many problems with bugs and I think I have learned to solve them faster. When I started this course, my knowledge in JS was almost nil and I thought I would never understand it, today I understand all the basics very well. I know you asked for a video but actually I'm so sick right now that I didn't want to be left at zero with this final test.</p>
